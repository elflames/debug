OS X System Preference Pane to turn on debugging of DNS/syslog/Kerberos/Directory Services
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Debug is a System Preference Pane that allows you to easily figure out complex enterprise issues by capuring logging.  It allows an administrator to have a user install the preference pane, turn it on, and then collect the logs.
